# password-generator-js
This is a password generator developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description

This password generator has a form to ask the user what specifications they need to include in their password. This includes a slide bar for the number of characters from 8-128 and check boxes for uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. 

The user then hits the submit button which triggers the `click` eventListener in the javascript code to generate the password.

The new password is printed to the box and I added a `Copy Password` button for the user to copy it to their clipboard.

## Javascript Features

* I used functions to create an array by checking the form values and concatenating the characters together to the requested password length.  

## CSS and HTML

* I designed the password generator to be responsive using media queries.

* The buttons all contain hover selectors for user ease.
